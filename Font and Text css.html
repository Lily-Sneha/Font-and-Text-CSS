                The present world, especially developing countries including India, is facing problems of
                over-population, poverty and illiteracy. There is tremendous growth in human population at a very fast
                pace and consequently causing depletion of natural resources day-by-day. The land and the natural
                resources are limited but the numbers of mouths to feed are going up and up.

                Under such circumstances, it is really very difficult task to protect, propagate and strive for place to
                the wildlife. Thus, realizing the conditions of various sectors of our country particularly
                socio-economic life, the wildlife must be managed and guided by the efficient and intensive land-use
                concept.

                We should propagate the wildlife through the concept of various ways by educating and motivating the
                public taking economical benefits from the wildlife, the renewable natural resources, for the common
                mass. This is possible through the concept of multiple-use of the land. Hence, multiple-use concept
                means that the resources not only keeping in only one use, should be utilized or used in multiple uses
                or directions so that maximum productions or benefits may be taken from it.

                    <h3>Herbivores</h3>
                    <p class="para">
                        Some animals eat only plants, making them herbivores. Often, herbivores concentrate their
                        munching on just the fruits or seeds of plants, ignoring stems, leaves, and roots. Herbivores
                        have special digestive tracts that are designed to handle different types of plants they might
                        eat. Herbivores usually have big front teeth, called incisors. These teeth are used to grasp and
                        cut plants. Herbivores also have molars in the back, which they use to grind up the plants in
                        their mouths. Herbivores are often very large animals, such as cows, deer, and elk. As you might
                        imagine, it takes a lot of food to give a large herbivore the energy it needs. That is why
                        herbivores may spend a large part of their day eating. Herbivores can also be medium-sized
                        animals such as sheep or goats. Examples of small herbivores include squirrels and chipmunks.
                        Herbivores need a lot of food to satisfy their hunger.

                    <h3>Omnivores</h3>
                    <p class="para">
                        Animals that eat both animals and plants are called omnivores. This type of animal has the
                        Some scientists
                        call omnivores “opportunistic eaters.” This means that they can and will eat almost anything
                        that is around when they are hungry. For example, an omnivore
                        will eat fruits and nuts growing on plants during the summer, and it will also hunt for meat.
                        Because omnivores eat almost any type of food, they have many
                        different types of teeth. These animals have incisors in the front for cutting. They also have
                        canines, which help them tear up meat. Raccoons and pigs are examples of
                        medium-sized omnivores. Many birds eat both insects and berries, making them omnivores.
                        Omnivores live in every type of environment, including deserts, forests, water, and even the
                        arctic. The arctic ground squirrel will feast on insects and plants to survive.

                    <h3>Carnivorus</h3>
                    <p class="para">
                        A mammal that eats only the meat from other animals is a carnivore. In the wild, a carnivore
                        will hunt other animals for food. Carnivores usually have to eat a lot to give them the energy
                        Sometimes these animals have to spend most of their days hunting to make sure they
                        get enough food. Because carnivores need to cut and tear up their food, they have big canine
                        teeth and sharp molars. Carnivores usually have small incisors in the front of their mouths. Big
                        carnivores include lions, tigers, and wolves. Some birds such as hawks and eagles are also
                        carnivores. Snakes are usually carnivores as well. Small carnivores include frogs,
                        and spiders. Carnivores provide an important service in the wild because they help
                        control the population of other animals. If carnivores were not hunting and removing these
                        animals from environments, these animals could overpopulate an area.
